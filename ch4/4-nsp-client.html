<!--
    When you create one or more sockets in the same namespace, 
    the first connection is reused, for example:
        const first = manager.socket('/home')
        const second = manager.socket('/home') // <- reuses first connection
    
    On client side, if there were no reserved connections, then
    switching to a namespace that was not used before would result 
    in a new connection being created. If you remove the following
    two lines of code, you will notice that there is a slow response
    when switching to a different namespace because a new connection
    is created instead of being reused.
        manager.socket('/en')
        manager.socket('/es')

    We could have been created two sockets that point to two different
    namespaces, then we could have added two event listeners connect and
    data to each socket, but we would have gotten repeated code.
